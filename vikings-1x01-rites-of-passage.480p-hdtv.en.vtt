come on. Let's go home.

Watch.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.888
Agh!

05:22.110 --> 05:24.878
What are you two doing?

05:24.979 --> 05:27.748
I'm taking Bjorn
to the thing tomorrow.

05:30.618 --> 05:33.687
Not yet. He's not old enough.

05:33.788 --> 05:35.322
He's twelve years old.

05:35.423 --> 05:36.924
Take him next year.

05:37.025 --> 05:39.259
Next year is soon enough.

05:39.361 --> 05:42.863
He'll need a silk ribbon,
Lagertha.

05:45.667 --> 05:48.268
You're a handsome boy.

05:48.370 --> 05:49.803
Funny ears, though.

05:56.144 --> 05:59.713
<i>Don't sleep with
lots of women in Kattegat.</i>

05:59.814 --> 06:01.915
I can do without it
for a few days.

06:04.018 --> 06:06.854
Is that another way
of saying you love me?

06:09.958 --> 06:10.858
Huh?

06:10.959 --> 06:13.360
I always dream of you.

06:14.362 --> 06:15.529
Last night,

06:15.630 --> 06:19.700
I dreamt you were feeding me
blood pudding.

06:20.935 --> 06:23.170
What does that mean?

06:23.271 --> 06:25.939
It means you're giving me
your heart.

06:37.685 --> 06:38.886
<i>Get your dog, boy.</i>

06:38.987 --> 06:41.889
<i>Frodi! Come on, boy.</i>

06:56.604 --> 06:58.405
<i>What will happen at the thing?</i>

06:58.506 --> 07:01.275
<i>The Earl will deal
with some criminal offences</i>

07:01.376 --> 07:05.078
<i>and then, we'll discuss</i>
<i>the summer raids.</i>

07:05.180 --> 07:07.114
And where will you go?

07:07.215 --> 07:09.149
The Earl decides.

07:09.250 --> 07:10.884
He owns the ships.

07:12.821 --> 07:14.555
He'll send us to the east,

07:14.656 --> 07:17.958
as always, to the baltic lands.

07:18.059 --> 07:19.927
But I want to know
what is to the west...

07:20.028 --> 07:23.063
what cities and gods
are over there.

07:23.164 --> 07:26.900
See, I'm not satisfied...
With this.

07:32.841 --> 07:36.176
Odin gave his eye
to acquire knowledge,

07:38.379 --> 07:40.581
but I would give far more.

07:45.153 --> 07:47.988
And will Earl
Haraldson let you?

07:52.327 --> 07:53.994
<i>Good.</i>

07:54.963 --> 07:57.197
Like this, nice and tight..

07:59.133 --> 08:01.401
<i>And on three.</i>

08:01.503 --> 08:03.704
<i>One, two, three.</i>

08:05.540 --> 08:07.741
Very good, Gyda.

08:13.214 --> 08:15.115
Gyda, feed the goats.

08:17.652 --> 08:18.652
Go on!

08:21.990 --> 08:22.956
What do you want?

08:23.057 --> 08:24.992
We know you're all alone here.

08:25.093 --> 08:26.827
All the men are gone.

08:27.829 --> 08:31.231
If you're thirsty,
I will give you a drink.

08:31.332 --> 08:33.567
If you're hungry,
I will feed you.

08:33.668 --> 08:36.136
Otherwise, you must go.

08:36.237 --> 08:40.440
<i>We will eat and drink</i> after
we've satisfied our other needs.

08:51.986 --> 08:54.621
<i>I don't want to kill you,</i>
<i>woman.</i>

08:54.722 --> 08:55.622
You couldn't kill me

08:55.723 --> 08:58.392
if you tried
for a hundred years.

09:02.163 --> 09:04.164
Aggghhhhh!

09:17.245 --> 09:18.245
Out!

09:26.821 --> 09:29.456
<i>I went to
confess my love to her</i>

09:29.557 --> 09:31.525
<i>but I was set upon by a bear</i>

09:31.626 --> 09:35.462
<i>and an enormous hound</i>
<i>who guarded her home.</i>

09:35.563 --> 09:38.632
I killed the bear with my spear

09:40.068 --> 09:41.668
and I managed
to strangle the hound

09:41.769 --> 09:43.170
with my bare hands.

09:45.673 --> 09:48.108
And that is how I gained
her hand in marriage.

09:51.179 --> 09:54.014
Did she tell you
the same story?

09:55.617 --> 09:56.617
Just about.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.227
<i>Are you ready to receive</i>
<i>your arm ring</i>

10:07.328 --> 10:09.396
and become a man?

10:09.497 --> 10:10.931
Yes.

10:11.032 --> 10:12.299
And what does a man do?

10:14.669 --> 10:16.436
He fights.

10:16.537 --> 10:17.771
<i>And...?</i>

10:18.773 --> 10:21.041
He looks after his family.

10:22.076 --> 10:23.777
<i>That's right.</i>

10:23.878 --> 10:26.480
Could you look after
our family?

10:29.250 --> 10:32.486
What do you mean?
You look after us.

10:32.587 --> 10:34.187
Say I wasn't there.

10:36.491 --> 10:39.760
<i>I have a big decision to make.</i>

10:39.861 --> 10:41.862
It may change many things.

10:44.232 --> 10:45.599
<i>Now, go to sleep.</i>

10:45.700 --> 10:48.101
You have a big day tomorrow.

12:13.721 --> 12:15.322
Arrggghhh!

12:15.423 --> 12:16.423
Bjorn!

12:19.761 --> 12:21.394
So, here you are, brother.

12:22.396 --> 12:23.463
Rollo.

12:23.564 --> 12:25.465
By frey and all the
gods how you've grown.

12:25.566 --> 12:26.666
Hello, rollo.

12:26.768 --> 12:28.101
Are you here for the thing?

12:28.202 --> 12:30.570
You're a real man now.

12:30.671 --> 12:32.239
Come, let's get a drink.

12:41.449 --> 12:43.383
Looking a little pale, Bjorn.

12:45.419 --> 12:48.421
Why don't you go lie down, hmm?

12:53.327 --> 12:57.297
So where do you think the
Earl is going to send us this year?

12:57.398 --> 12:58.298
Those bastards to the east

12:58.399 --> 13:00.400
are as poor as we are.

13:00.501 --> 13:01.835
I know.

13:04.772 --> 13:07.007
That's why we should sail west.

13:07.108 --> 13:09.409
I've heard such tales, rollo.

13:09.510 --> 13:12.312
Great towns, and cities,
and treasures;

13:12.413 --> 13:16.283
Hordes of gold and silver,
and... and a new God.

13:16.384 --> 13:18.285
I've heard those stories too.

13:18.386 --> 13:20.387
But what does it mean?

13:20.488 --> 13:23.990
We can't sail across
an open ocean.

13:24.091 --> 13:25.558
I believe there's a way

13:26.277 --> 13:27.659
to go west.

13:30.832 --> 13:35.037
I have something
that will change everything.

13:36.737 --> 13:37.737
What?

13:42.410 --> 13:43.343
What is that?

13:43.444 --> 13:44.544
Now just listen.

13:44.645 --> 13:47.614
A while back, I met someone,

13:47.715 --> 13:49.950
a wanderer.

13:50.051 --> 13:51.551
He told me that it was possible

13:51.652 --> 13:55.255
to go west, over the open sea,

13:55.356 --> 13:56.690
using this.

14:00.661 --> 14:02.395
It's a sun-board.

14:03.431 --> 14:05.365
It needs to sit in water.

14:05.466 --> 14:07.567
Another wanderer?

14:07.668 --> 14:08.902
This time is different.

14:09.003 --> 14:11.471
<i>Now tell me, Ragnar,
this-this wanderer of yours,</i>

14:11.572 --> 14:13.173
has he ever sailed
west himself?

14:13.274 --> 14:15.308
Just get some water.

14:29.323 --> 14:31.892
<i>Now, this candle is the sun.</i>

14:31.993 --> 14:33.560
Every day...

14:33.661 --> 14:36.930
The sun rises up into the sky
until noon.

14:37.031 --> 14:38.031
See how the shadow shortens?

14:39.834 --> 14:41.868
<i>At noon, it is at its shortest.</i>

14:41.969 --> 14:43.637
That only tells me how
far South I have travelled.

14:43.738 --> 14:46.172
Didn't I just tell you
to listen?!

14:48.175 --> 14:49.242
<i>The day before sailing</i>

14:49.343 --> 14:51.678
<i>you mark a circle around</i>
<i>the pointer</i>

14:51.779 --> 14:55.282
where the shadow
is at its shortest at noon.

14:55.383 --> 14:57.117
The next day at sea,

14:57.218 --> 14:59.819
you place the board
back into water around noon

14:59.921 --> 15:00.854
and watch the shadow.

15:02.623 --> 15:05.358
<i>If the shadow only touches</i>
<i>the circle...</i>

15:05.459 --> 15:07.093
Your course remains true?

15:07.194 --> 15:08.561
Yes.

15:08.663 --> 15:12.532
And if it passes outside
the circle, like this...

15:12.633 --> 15:14.701
Then you have drifted

15:14.802 --> 15:16.369
and you must steer
further South.

15:16.470 --> 15:18.538
Yes.

15:18.639 --> 15:21.308
And what if it never
reaches the circle?

15:21.409 --> 15:22.442
<i>Then you are too far South</i>

15:22.543 --> 15:23.877
and must steer more
to the north.

15:23.978 --> 15:25.378
That's it!

15:26.380 --> 15:29.449
Keep the noon shadow
on the circle

15:29.550 --> 15:31.818
and your course will be true,

15:31.919 --> 15:32.919
west.

15:39.293 --> 15:41.695
But what if there is
no sun, hmm?

15:41.796 --> 15:43.763
How can the board
help you then?

15:43.864 --> 15:46.633
How could you find your way?

15:50.371 --> 15:51.871
Using this.

15:56.877 --> 15:58.178
Follow me outside.

16:03.551 --> 16:05.618
They call it a sun-stone.

16:09.623 --> 16:10.957
Oh! You see?

16:11.959 --> 16:13.660
There is the sun.

16:13.761 --> 16:15.428
Now we go west.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.937
Come on. Come on.

16:36.254 --> 16:37.988
<i>Silence!</i>

16:38.055 --> 16:39.556
Silence!

16:59.610 --> 17:01.211
<i>Olaf Anwend.</i>

17:01.312 --> 17:04.881
You have pleaded guilty
to the charge of stealing.

17:04.949 --> 17:08.285
<i>Tomorrow, you will run</i>
<i>a gauntlet of stones and turf</i>

17:08.386 --> 17:09.586
as punishment.

17:10.955 --> 17:13.723
Yes, lord. Thank you, lord.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.659
<i>Let it be known
a fine is to be paid</i>

17:15.760 --> 17:19.095
by anyone who fails
to throw something.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.735
<i>Bring in the next accused.</i>

17:26.771 --> 17:28.738
There he is! Murderer!

17:32.210 --> 17:33.643
Eric Trygvasson,

17:33.744 --> 17:37.180
you are accused of the murder
of Sigvald strut

17:37.281 --> 17:38.315
this January.

17:39.550 --> 17:40.750
How do you plead?

17:40.852 --> 17:42.519
<i>It wasn't murder, lord.</i>

17:42.587 --> 17:44.221
I killed him in self-defense.

17:44.322 --> 17:46.756
<i>Liar!</i>

17:47.658 --> 17:48.525
<i>If it wasn't murder,</i>

17:48.593 --> 17:49.793
<i>why did you not declare</i>
<i>your crime</i>

17:49.861 --> 17:52.562
to the first person
that you met afterwards,

17:52.663 --> 17:54.764
<i>as the law obliges?</i>

17:54.866 --> 17:57.901
In fact, you passed by
several houses

17:59.136 --> 18:00.704
before you reported it.

18:00.771 --> 18:02.873
I thought the
relatives of the dead man

18:02.940 --> 18:04.207
might be living in them.

18:06.944 --> 18:09.846
<i>The law allows
you to pass two houses</i>

18:09.947 --> 18:11.948
in such circumstances,

18:12.016 --> 18:13.450
but never a third.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.585
You murdered
my brother in cold blood!

18:15.653 --> 18:17.787
It's not true!

18:17.855 --> 18:20.257
We argued about
some disputed land.

18:20.358 --> 18:21.625
He pulled out a knife.

18:21.726 --> 18:24.294
You wanted
that land for yourself!

18:24.395 --> 18:27.230
<i>You're a liar and a coward.</i>

18:27.298 --> 18:29.900
Who says I'm a coward?
I'm not a coward!

18:31.636 --> 18:32.636
Silence!

18:34.305 --> 18:37.274
<i>As the normal procedures</i>
<i>were not followed,</i>

18:37.375 --> 18:40.577
this killing cannot be
atoned for

18:40.645 --> 18:43.179
by compensating
the victim's family.

18:43.281 --> 18:47.317
Murder is a dishonorable deed
amongst our people.

18:47.385 --> 18:51.321
Carried out in secret,
unacknowledged,

18:51.389 --> 18:52.789
and likely to give rise

18:52.890 --> 18:55.091
to a series of revenge killings

18:55.192 --> 18:57.427
that would involve
your own family.

18:57.528 --> 19:03.433
Lord, you knew about that land.
<i>You knew I had a claim to it...</i>

19:03.534 --> 19:04.634
enough!

19:05.836 --> 19:08.872
<i>I ask you to look</i>
<i>to the accused.</i>

19:10.174 --> 19:12.976
If you think that he is guilty,

19:13.077 --> 19:14.511
raise your arms.

19:27.558 --> 19:29.993
The decision must be unanimous.

19:41.272 --> 19:42.706
Eric Trygvasson,

19:44.175 --> 19:46.176
<i>you have been found guilty</i>
<i>of murder.</i>

19:46.277 --> 19:47.911
Yes! Justice!

19:49.080 --> 19:51.247
How do you wish to die?

19:53.184 --> 19:54.951
By beheading, lord.

19:56.253 --> 19:58.021
Your wish is granted.

19:58.089 --> 20:00.857
You shall be executed tomorrow.

20:02.093 --> 20:05.562
After which we will shall feast
and talk about the summer raids.

20:25.249 --> 20:26.516
You have to.

20:34.759 --> 20:36.159
Yeah! Yeah!

21:07.691 --> 21:10.093
<i>Why is he smiling, father?</i>

21:10.194 --> 21:14.264
He wants to die
well, without fear,

21:14.331 --> 21:16.499
<i>to atone for his sins.</i>

21:26.377 --> 21:28.678
You must watch, for his sake.

21:29.947 --> 21:33.383
<i>It's his only hope
of reaching Valhalla.</i>

21:48.599 --> 21:50.200
Feed him to your pigs!

21:53.637 --> 21:55.405
And I curse him.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.208
May he never enter Valhalla.

21:59.210 --> 22:01.744
May he never feast
with the gods.

22:07.118 --> 22:08.785
Why did he do that?

22:08.853 --> 22:11.321
He should not have done that.

22:11.388 --> 22:13.857
<i>Someone told me he
wanted that land for himself</i>

22:13.958 --> 22:15.325
and he knew Trygvasson
had the best claim to it,

22:15.392 --> 22:17.260
but refused to sell it.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.231
You hear that, boy?

22:21.298 --> 22:23.399
This how things are done
around here.

22:25.303 --> 22:27.637
<i>Olaf, son of Ingolf,</i>

22:27.738 --> 22:29.506
<i>Bjorn, son of Ragnar.</i>

22:30.508 --> 22:34.144
May you accept this gift
of salt and earth

22:35.379 --> 22:36.680
<i>to remind yourself</i>

22:36.781 --> 22:40.450
that you belong to both
the land and the sea.

22:48.392 --> 22:51.361
These arm rings bind you
in loyalty to me,

22:51.462 --> 22:53.630
your lord, your chieftain.

22:54.632 --> 22:57.033
<i>Any oath that you swear</i>
<i>on these rings</i>

22:57.134 --> 22:59.502
<i>must be honored and kept.</i>

22:59.604 --> 23:01.204
<i>Do you understand</i>
<i>and swear to this?</i>

23:01.305 --> 23:03.173
Yes, lord.

23:03.274 --> 23:05.208
And do you
freely give your fealty to me,

23:05.309 --> 23:07.177
your lord, your chieftain?

23:07.278 --> 23:08.678
Yes, lord.

23:11.148 --> 23:12.249
Good.

23:12.350 --> 23:14.517
You may put on the arm rings.

23:21.192 --> 23:23.193
Come here.

23:39.543 --> 23:40.443
<i>Wooooo!</i>

23:48.686 --> 23:50.921
Let us feast!

23:51.022 --> 23:52.122
My lord,

23:53.524 --> 23:55.525
<i>we all want to feast,</i>

23:55.626 --> 23:57.093
but we also want to know

23:57.194 --> 23:58.428
where we will be raiding
this summer.

23:59.830 --> 24:01.164
Can't it wait, Ragnar?

24:02.166 --> 24:04.100
<i>No. Tell us.</i>

24:04.201 --> 24:06.303
We want to know.

24:06.404 --> 24:08.238
We have a right to know.

24:08.339 --> 24:09.940
<i>Very well.</i>

24:10.041 --> 24:13.576
<i>We will raid east again,</i>
<i>to the Eastlands,</i>

24:13.678 --> 24:14.577
and into Russia.

24:14.679 --> 24:17.480
Every year

24:17.581 --> 24:19.683
we go to the same places!

24:23.054 --> 24:25.155
But there is an alternative...

24:28.059 --> 24:29.259
If you choose.

24:32.096 --> 24:35.665
Oh yes, yes. Choice, yes.

24:35.766 --> 24:39.502
I have heard of these rumors,
these stories;

24:39.603 --> 24:41.471
That if we travel west,

24:41.572 --> 24:43.340
<i>that we will somehow</i>
<i>reach a land</i>

24:43.441 --> 24:45.475
<i>that is rich and plentiful.</i>

24:47.945 --> 24:51.081
But I tell you that
I will not risk my ships

24:51.182 --> 24:52.248
or my reputation

24:53.250 --> 24:55.452
on such a deluded fantasy.

24:57.588 --> 25:00.256
They are my ships -
I pay for them...

25:00.358 --> 25:03.259
and they go where
I tell them to go.

25:03.361 --> 25:06.262
Now that's the end
of the matter.

25:10.368 --> 25:11.668
Let's feast!

25:26.183 --> 25:28.284
<i>Let me see!</i>

25:29.787 --> 25:31.688
<i>It's a fine ring.</i>

25:37.661 --> 25:39.496
Ragnar Lothbrok,

25:40.498 --> 25:43.066
<i>Earl Haraldson wants to</i>
<i>speak with you...</i>

25:43.167 --> 25:44.167
in private.

25:46.971 --> 25:48.972
<i>Stay with your Uncle.</i>

26:01.285 --> 26:02.685
Ragnar Lothbrok...

26:06.624 --> 26:07.757
Sit down.

26:13.664 --> 26:15.331
Are you hungry?

26:16.901 --> 26:18.068
Yes, lord.

26:23.107 --> 26:25.642
You want to feast in my hall?

26:25.743 --> 26:28.011
You want to sail in my ships?

26:28.112 --> 26:30.313
Anything else you want from me?

26:31.649 --> 26:32.715
Lord...

26:32.817 --> 26:36.019
You keep
talking about the west...

26:36.120 --> 26:37.954
what do you know of it, hmm?

26:38.956 --> 26:40.252
Why are you so certain

26:40.377 --> 26:43.311
that it's a land
of great riches, hmm?

26:43.627 --> 26:46.196
<i>I can't be sure.</i>

26:46.297 --> 26:47.263
But I believe that...

26:47.364 --> 26:50.600
I don't care what you believe.

26:50.701 --> 26:53.236
You insulted me out there,

26:53.337 --> 26:56.206
and not for the first time,

26:56.307 --> 27:00.443
but, believe me,
it will be the last.

27:07.451 --> 27:10.520
<i>Who told you you could go?</i>

27:16.227 --> 27:18.791
You are a farmer.

27:20.564 --> 27:22.999
You should be content
with your lot.

27:24.869 --> 27:27.871
Farms are few
and in great demand,

27:29.473 --> 27:31.307
and there are many people here

27:31.408 --> 27:35.044
who would like to possess
your land.

27:36.847 --> 27:39.182
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

27:41.218 --> 27:42.519
I understand.

27:44.088 --> 27:47.590
Then don't ever stick your nose
in my face again.

28:02.072 --> 28:05.233
I don't trust him. Watch him.

28:15.976 --> 28:17.877
<i>Where are they?</i>

28:17.978 --> 28:19.445
Where are my sons?

28:19.513 --> 28:21.781
You said you'd found them.

29:06.293 --> 29:09.428
<i>Where are we going now?
I'm so tired.</i>

29:09.496 --> 29:12.665
<i>To talk to the gods.</i>

29:12.766 --> 29:14.200
It's what we do.

29:25.212 --> 29:28.214
Why don't you come in?
I'm waiting.

29:34.387 --> 29:35.688
Sit.

29:41.228 --> 29:43.529
What do you want?

29:43.630 --> 29:47.633
I want to know what
the gods have in store.

29:47.734 --> 29:48.634
<i>For you...</i>

29:48.735 --> 29:50.636
Or for the boy?

29:51.738 --> 29:54.373
I'm more interested in myself.

29:55.876 --> 29:58.177
The gods desire you
to have a great future.

29:58.278 --> 29:59.712
I see that.

30:00.914 --> 30:02.548
But they can withdraw
their goodwill

30:02.649 --> 30:03.649
at any time.

30:05.719 --> 30:08.454
<i>To have this great future,</i>

30:08.555 --> 30:10.656
must I challenge the law?

30:10.724 --> 30:15.527
You must convince
the gods to alter the runes

30:17.097 --> 30:19.164
so they work in your favor.

30:20.166 --> 30:22.868
But the laws of men

30:22.969 --> 30:27.339
are far below the workings
and shapings of the gods.

30:30.043 --> 30:33.545
So I should take
the laws of men

30:33.613 --> 30:35.614
into my own hands?

30:39.619 --> 30:41.220
Answer me.

30:41.321 --> 30:43.689
You already have your answer.

30:43.790 --> 30:44.790
No I don't.

30:47.227 --> 30:50.329
<i>Well, then go
and ask the gods yourself.</i>

30:50.430 --> 30:52.331
What are you afraid of?

30:59.973 --> 31:01.573
<i>Wait outside.</i>

31:01.675 --> 31:04.009
<i>All right.</i>

31:04.077 --> 31:07.112
You haven't helped me at all,
ancient one.

31:10.984 --> 31:13.619
Perhaps you asked
the wrong questions.

31:33.239 --> 31:35.541
We have someone
special to visit.

31:35.642 --> 31:37.710
His name is Floki.

31:37.811 --> 31:39.244
<i>Floki?</i>

31:39.346 --> 31:40.813
Like loki the God?

31:42.082 --> 31:44.516
Yes, only different.

31:45.618 --> 31:47.519
How is he different?

31:47.620 --> 31:48.954
He's not a God.

31:49.956 --> 31:52.558
Why didn't he come
to the thing?

31:52.625 --> 31:54.426
Because...

31:55.428 --> 31:56.528
Because he's shy.

32:03.603 --> 32:04.903
<i>Floki,</i>

32:04.971 --> 32:07.172
this is my son, Bjorn.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.540
<i>Hello.</i>

32:08.608 --> 32:10.209
How are you?

32:10.310 --> 32:12.611
Well. Thank you, sir.

32:13.980 --> 32:14.980
Let me see.

32:17.217 --> 32:18.250
Ah!

32:18.752 --> 32:21.520
You have your father's eyes...

32:21.588 --> 32:23.188
Unfortunately.

32:24.190 --> 32:26.225
Why unfortunately?

32:26.292 --> 32:28.527
It means he will be like you,

32:28.628 --> 32:31.363
and therefore he will want
to do better than you,

32:31.464 --> 32:32.831
and you will hate him for it.

32:36.302 --> 32:39.104
How can you tell that
by just looking at my face?

32:39.172 --> 32:41.340
Oh, it's the same with trees.

32:41.441 --> 32:43.909
I can tell which trees
will make the best planks

32:43.977 --> 32:46.245
just by looking at them.

32:46.581 --> 32:49.269
I can look inside the tree.

32:50.717 --> 32:52.684
<i>Floki is a boat-builder...</i>

32:52.786 --> 32:54.053
Among other things.

33:21.915 --> 33:22.915
Hmm...

33:26.286 --> 33:27.286
This is one.

33:28.755 --> 33:31.557
Inside this tree are two
almost perfect planks.

33:31.658 --> 33:34.159
They will bend, then curve,

33:34.260 --> 33:35.160
like a woman's body

33:35.261 --> 33:36.662
from the thighs to the back.

33:36.763 --> 33:40.165
When I split this tree
I will find them.

33:42.469 --> 33:43.635
You can see that?

33:46.739 --> 33:48.740
Do you think I'm joking?

33:59.853 --> 34:02.187
I joke about many things,

34:02.288 --> 34:04.189
son of Ragnar,

34:04.290 --> 34:06.758
but never about ship-building.

34:07.760 --> 34:11.864
Do you imagine ships
are just dead things?

34:11.931 --> 34:14.366
<i>So... what about our boat?</i>

34:19.172 --> 34:21.440
<i>It will be lighter
and carry a bigger sail.</i>

34:21.541 --> 34:22.975
The construction is different.

34:23.076 --> 34:25.043
It's built with
a strong central plank.

34:25.111 --> 34:26.245
The two strakes above it
are nailed

34:26.346 --> 34:28.080
directly onto the knees
of the frame.

34:28.181 --> 34:30.149
But the ones below - look!...

34:30.250 --> 34:31.650
are cleated and lashed
onto the frames,

34:31.751 --> 34:32.751
not nailed,

34:32.819 --> 34:35.220
so they can move in relation
to each other.

34:35.288 --> 34:37.823
This means the boat won't butt
against the waves like a goat,

34:37.924 --> 34:39.958
but move over them
like a ripple.

34:40.059 --> 34:41.426
Hmm.

34:41.528 --> 34:43.629
<i>The hull is deeper. How
will my men set their oars?</i>

34:43.696 --> 34:45.597
<i>I will cut them
into the sheerstrakes,</i>

34:45.698 --> 34:48.000
<i>and the ports can be closed</i>
<i>when the boat is at sea.</i>

34:48.067 --> 34:50.102
And you think it could handle
long sea voyages?

34:50.203 --> 34:53.605
That's why I'm building it.

34:55.975 --> 34:58.877
But will it be strong enough?

34:58.978 --> 35:01.613
We won't know that
until we try.

35:03.516 --> 35:05.884
<i>For the anchor.</i>

35:05.952 --> 35:09.188
It's all I have left
from last summer's raids.

35:09.289 --> 35:10.923
Don't worry.

35:11.024 --> 35:13.792
We'll soon be as rich
as dwarves!

35:23.684 --> 35:25.184
I missed you.

35:33.761 --> 35:35.995
<i>Did anything happen</i>
<i>while we were away?</i>

35:39.066 --> 35:40.166
No.

35:40.267 --> 35:41.667
<i>Hmm.</i>

35:44.705 --> 35:47.206
Did you miss me?

35:53.047 --> 35:55.048
I ached with love longing.

35:57.051 --> 35:59.485
My belly was empty of laughter.

36:00.921 --> 36:03.589
Is that what you want? Hmm?

36:07.861 --> 36:10.530
You want me to make you laugh?

36:11.532 --> 36:13.733
I don't want to laugh now.

36:16.770 --> 36:19.038
I want to ride you,
like a bull.

36:24.912 --> 36:26.045
Like a wild bull.

36:53.707 --> 36:55.641
Hello, young Bjorn.

36:55.742 --> 36:57.376
Hello, rollo.

36:57.478 --> 36:59.679
Where are your parents?

36:59.780 --> 37:01.781
They are having sex.

37:03.650 --> 37:05.651
Well, uh...

37:08.722 --> 37:11.124
I guess we'll have to wait.

37:24.671 --> 37:26.272
So, Gyda,

37:27.274 --> 37:30.009
is your mother teaching you
<i>how to use a shield?</i>

37:30.110 --> 37:33.412
Yes, I know how
to use a shield.

37:33.514 --> 37:36.015
Your mother was a famous
shield-maiden.

37:36.116 --> 37:37.016
<i>Was?</i>

37:37.117 --> 37:39.852
Is a famous shield-maiden.

37:39.953 --> 37:41.053
<i>Come on, children, to bed.</i>

37:41.155 --> 37:41.988
<i>Do I have to?</i>

37:42.089 --> 37:43.289
Let's leave the men.

37:43.390 --> 37:45.791
But I'm a man. I have a ring.

37:45.893 --> 37:47.527
<i>Let him stay awhile.</i>

37:47.628 --> 37:48.628
To bed!

37:51.999 --> 37:53.399
<i>Say good night.</i>

37:53.500 --> 37:55.034
Good night, my children.

37:57.137 --> 37:58.037
Good night.

37:58.138 --> 37:59.138
<i>Hey!</i>

38:02.042 --> 38:03.676
Shhhaaaaaa!

38:13.153 --> 38:15.188
Tell me your news.

38:15.289 --> 38:17.290
What about the boat?

38:17.391 --> 38:19.125
It's nearly ready.

38:21.328 --> 38:24.330
I won't go under your command.

38:26.233 --> 38:29.635
I won't go
unless we're all equal.

38:29.736 --> 38:32.138
<i>We are brothers.</i>

38:33.540 --> 38:36.309
You and I will always be equal.

38:42.282 --> 38:44.750
Then we must find a crew.

38:44.851 --> 38:49.622
Not many men will go against
the wishes of Haraldson.

38:49.723 --> 38:51.524
Many will be afraid,

38:52.793 --> 38:56.195
some may even go to him
and betray us.

38:58.999 --> 39:00.132
I must go piss.

39:34.134 --> 39:36.102
Yesterday, I was
with a girl from the town.

39:36.203 --> 39:37.270
Thank you.

39:38.272 --> 39:40.273
A good-looking girl too.

39:45.746 --> 39:49.649
But when she shouted out
in pleasure,

39:49.750 --> 39:52.184
I didn't see,

39:54.254 --> 39:55.888
I saw yours.

39:58.558 --> 39:59.892
Lagertha...

40:01.428 --> 40:03.429
Don't talk like that.

40:03.530 --> 40:05.197
<i>Why not?</i>

40:06.900 --> 40:10.102
I think about you all the time.

40:10.203 --> 40:12.104
That's too bad.

40:13.807 --> 40:16.542
Don't insult me, shield-maiden.

40:16.643 --> 40:17.710
No.

40:17.811 --> 40:20.179
I would never insult you.

40:20.280 --> 40:22.181
You're too great a warrior...

40:26.119 --> 40:28.921
But perhaps not so great a man.

41:05.125 --> 41:06.859
I saw something.

41:07.861 --> 41:09.128
What did you see?

41:11.164 --> 41:12.164
A sign.

41:14.601 --> 41:18.504
It made me certain
we're doing the right thing.

41:25.512 --> 41:26.812
Good night, brother.

41:45.999 --> 41:47.666
Set the sail.

41:49.336 --> 41:51.170
Floki! The sail!

41:52.672 --> 41:53.572
She'll sink.

41:53.673 --> 41:54.940
No she bloody won't!

41:55.041 --> 41:58.244
<i>I shouldn't have
pretended to build such a boat.</i>

41:58.345 --> 42:00.646
It's beyond
my humble capabilities.

42:01.648 --> 42:04.116
I'll set the sail.

42:04.217 --> 42:05.918
Floki I'm sorry, Ragnar.

42:06.019 --> 42:08.421
I've wasted all your money.
It was all a joke.

42:08.522 --> 42:10.523
<i>Shut up, man.</i>

42:32.946 --> 42:34.380
Ha!

42:39.719 --> 42:42.121
Now it runs on its cool keel.

42:42.222 --> 42:43.989
<i>Oh, it's beautiful.</i>

42:44.090 --> 42:45.991
Why didn't you believe me?

42:46.092 --> 42:47.793
I told you I could do it!

42:51.331 --> 42:52.264
<i>Ah?</i>

42:52.365 --> 42:55.434
Now it's all up to you,
Ragnar Lothbrok.

43:25.001 --> 43:30.093
